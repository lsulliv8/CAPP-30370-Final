For my final project, I created a site that gives a brief explanation of The Hunger Games trilogy and three of the main characters. At the risk of giving away the entire series, I tried to give the audience a better understanding of what the books/movies are about.

<h2>Starred Items:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Breakpoints: I used the breakpoints on my homepage in the CSS file to let the page be tailored to different devices.</li>
<li> Three-up: I used the three-up layout on my homepage, putting 3 pictures of the different book covers across the top of the page. </li> 
<li> CSS Animation on A Loop: For this, I added a picture of Katniss with her bow flipping back and forth on my homepage as if she were about to be attacked by something. I implemented this by editing the keyframes in my CSS file.</li>
<li> CSS Animation that runs on user interaction: On my homepage if the user clicks on or hovers their mouse over the 3 images of the book covers, the pictures will scale to 1.5x their original size.</li>
<li> Background images: I included a background image on all of my pages for visual appeal. I added these in the CSS files.</li>
<li> JQuery Interaction: I applied my jquery javascript code to all of my pages.</li>
</ul>
