   <h4> Synopsis </h4> The Hunger Games trilogy takes place in a future nation known as Panem. The country consists of 12 (formerly 13) districts including the wealthiest one, known as the Capitol. The Capitol is very rich and is significantly more technologically advanced than the other districts, which continually struggle through poverty. As punishment for a past rebellion, during which district 13 was permanently and purposefully destroyed, an annual Hunger Games takes place. At these hunger games, each district has one day dedicated to choosing their one male and one female tribute. The tributes are between the ages of 12 and 18 and receive a certain number of entries into the lottery depending upon their age. There is then a televised Hunger Games during which all 24 tributes fight to the death, leaving one ultimate victor. The winning tribute, along with their district, is rewarded with food and other luxuries. The Games serve as a reminder to the people of the Capitolâ€™s power and lack of remorse in killing.
